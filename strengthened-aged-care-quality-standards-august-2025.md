These people may be experiencing sickness,* *frailty, disability, cognitive impairment or be nearing the end of their life. Access to a* *range of registered health practitioners, allied health professionals and allied health* *assistants is crucial to address these complex needs. Quality clinical care services* *can optimise an older person’s quality of life, reablement and maintenance of* *function. Improved health and wellbeing supports continued participation in activities* *that are enjoyable and give life meaning. *

*At all times, clinical care services provided should be person-centred, inclusive, safe,* *effective and coordinated. It should be planned and delivered in partnership with the* *older person, involving their supporters and others in line with the older person’s* *needs and preferences. Delivering safe, quality clinical care services requires a* *multidisciplinary approach with a skilled workforce with clear accountabilities that are* *supported to deliver contemporary, evidence-based care. Allied health professionals* *have distinct roles in reablement and maintenance of an older person’s functional* *capabilities. *

For example, implementation of processes for* *advance care planning in action 3.1.6 is critical to quality clinical care, including at the* *end of life \(action 5.7.2\). These systems and processes establish a baseline* *expectation which supports the delivery of person-centred and safe clinical care,* *ensuring that risks of harm to older people from clinical care are minimised and* *support continuous quality improvement. *

**Standard 7: The Residential **

## **Community **



## **Intent of Standard 7 **

*When people move into a residential care home, the residential community becomes* *a central feature of their lives. It is critical that older people feel safe and at home in* *the residential community, have opportunities to do things that are meaningful to* *them and are supported to maintain connections with people important to them. *

*Meaningful activities can include participating in hobbies or community groups,* *seeing friends and family or activities that contribute to the residential community* *such as gardening, cooking and setting tables. *

*A residential community can involve diverse members from different cultures and* *backgrounds. It is important that each older person's culture is respected, and their* *diversity valued so they feel included, safe and at home in the residential care home* *Given the scope of responsibility in residential care, providers also have increased* *requirements to ensure that older people have access to other services and to* *coordinate a planned transition to or from the residential care home to maximise* *continuity of care for older people. *

*Standard 7 is intended to apply only to residential care homes. *
