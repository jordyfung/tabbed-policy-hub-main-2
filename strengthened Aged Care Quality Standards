## Standard 5: Clinical Care

## Intent of Standard

_The Clinical Care Standard describes the responsibilities of providers to deliver safe
and quality clinical care services to older people. The governing body has overall
responsibility to ensure a clinical governance framework is implemented and to
monitor its effectiveness in supporting aged care workers to deliver quality clinical
care services. Providers operationalise the clinical governance framework and report
on its performance._

_Many older people who require clinical care services have multiple chronic co-
morbidities and complex care needs. These people may be experiencing sickness,
frailty, disability, cognitive impairment or be nearing the end of their life. Access to a
range of health professionals is crucial to address these complex needs. Quality
clinical care services can optimise an older person’s quality of life, reablement and
maintenance of function. Improved health and wellbeing supports continued
participation in activities that are enjoyable and give life meaning._

_At all times, clinical care services provided should be person-centred, inclusive, safe,
effective and coordinated. It should be planned and delivered in partnership with the
older person, involving their supporters and others in line with the older person’s
needs and preferences. Delivering safe, quality clinical care services requires a
multidisciplinary approach with a skilled workforce with clear accountabilities that are
supported to deliver contemporary, evidence-based care. Allied health professionals
have distinct roles in reablement and maintenance of an older person’s functional
capabilities._

_Effective implementation of Standard 5 is reliant on the systems and processes from
Standards 1–7. Standard 5 does not seek to replicate the base expectation of_


_understanding the person in Standard 1 or the base planning, assessment and
delivery expectation of Standard 3. For example, implementation of processes for
advance care planning in action 3.1.6 is critical to quality clinical care, including at the
end of life (action 5.7.2). These systems and processes establish a baseline
expectation which supports the delivery of person-centred and safe clinical care
services, ensuring that risks of harm to older people from clinical care services are
minimised and support continuous quality improvement._

## Standard 5 expectation statement for older people:

preferences._**

## Standard 6: Food and Nutrition

## Intent of Standard

_Access to nutritionally adequate food is a fundamental human right. Food, drink and
the dining experience can have a huge impact on a person’s quality of life. As people
age, they may lose their appetite or experience conditions that impact on their ability
to eat and drink. As such, it is particularly important that providers engage with older
people about what and how they like to eat and drink, deliver choice and meals that
are full of flavour, appetising and nutritious (including for older people with texture
modified diets), and support older people to consume as much as they want and
exercise dignity of risk._

_In many cultures, food also plays a large role in fostering feelings of inclusion and
belonging. The experience of sharing food and drink with other older people and their
supporters is important for many older people._

_Providers must draw on Standard 3 in delivering food services to ensure this is
informed by robust assessment and planning and funded aged care services are
delivered in line with the needs, goals and preferences of older people. It is also
critical for providers to monitor older people for malnutrition and dehydration and
respond appropriately where concerns are identified – this is addressed as part of
Standard 5._

them and are supported to maintain connections with people important to them.
Meaningful activities can include participating in hobbies or community groups,
seeing friends and family or activities that contribute to the residential community
such as gardening, cooking and setting tables._

_A residential community can involve diverse members from different cultures and
backgrounds. It is important that each older person's culture is respected, and their
diversity valued so they feel included, safe and at home in the service._

_Given the scope of responsibility in residential care, providers also have increased
requirements to ensure that older people have access to other services and to
coordinate a planned transition to or from the service to maximise continuity of care
for older people._

_Standard 7 is intended to apply only to residential care homes._
